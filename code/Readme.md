# Architecture Overview
```
The framework is organized into modular components that handle specific responsibilities:

main.py                             # Main orchestration
├── path_config.py                  # Path management
├── data_classes.py                 # Data structures  
├── io_operations.py                # File I/O operations
├── section_analysis.py             # Road section analysis
├── dynamic_analysis.py             # Vehicle behavior analysis
├── clustering.py                   # Hybrid clustering algorithms
├── coverage_reduction.py           # Test reduction logic
├── prioritization.py               # Road prioritization
├── comparison_analysis.py          # Approach comparison
└── visualization.py                # Results visualization

```
